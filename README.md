## Principal Component Filtration for Bioacoustics

In this project repository / environment we offer both a workflow to reproduce a novel bio-acoustic denoising algorithm

and an in depth exploratory analysis of the resulting data set post-transformation. Both the rigor and the motivation for our algorithm

is discussed in brief detail as well as the implications said method(s) have on the data set to which our methods are applied.
